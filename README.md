# Synergy React Assignment
# This repository contains two major tasks that demonstrate my skills in ReactJS: a User Management System with complete CRUD operations and a UI Design Task.

# 1. User Management System (CRUD Operations)
# In this task, I built a fully functional user management system where you can:

# Create a new user
# Read user details
# Update user information
# Delete users from the system
